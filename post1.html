            In a groundbreaking study, researchers confirmed that the majority of human interaction consists of nodding and repeating “that’s crazy” until one party leaves.<br><br>
            Experts suggest embracing the phrase as a valid form of communication. The study also points out that this phrase is often used as a filler during awkward silences in social settings, replacing real conversation.<br><br>
            "What people fail to realize is that this form of communication can be incredibly effective at bonding groups together, despite the lack of deep dialogue," said the lead researcher, Dr. Mark Petersen.<br><br>
            The results are being hailed as revolutionary in understanding human behavior and social connections.
