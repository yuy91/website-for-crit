            A haunting exploration of silence and static. The protagonist doesn’t speak—not because they can’t, but because the noise of the world is louder than any words.<br><br>
            There’s no soundtrack, just the hum of forgotten devices. It’s less of a film, more of a memory you’re not sure is yours.<br><br>
            ★★★☆☆
