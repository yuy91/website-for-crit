            <b>User123:</b> My friend keeps dating my exes... Should I say something?<br><br>

            <b>Reply1:</b> Honestly, hang them on eBay—at least you'd make some money.<br><br>

            <b>Reply2:</b> If this happened once, I'd be mad. Twice? We’re not friends anymore.<br><br>

            <b>Reply3:</b> She’s probably jealous. You have the life she wants, so she copies everything.<br><br>

            <b>Reply4:</b> Ever thought maybe she likes you and this is her way of staying close?<br><br>

            <b>Reply5:</b> She must be really insecure. I think you should talk to her about it.<br><br>

            <b>Reply6:</b> Maybe she’s just making sure your leftovers are safe. True friend vibes.<br><br>
