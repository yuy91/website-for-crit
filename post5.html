            My friend keeps dating my exes... Should I say something?<br>
            It’s not just once — this has happened THREE times now. Every time I break up with someone, a few weeks later she’s suddenly "dating" them. At first I thought it was a coincidence, but now it’s getting weird. I don’t know if I’m overreacting or if this is just plain disrespectful. Has anyone dealt with something like this before?

            Honestly, hang them on eBay—at least you'd make some money.

            If this happened once, I'd be mad. Twice? We’re not friends anymore.

            She’s probably jealous. You have the life she wants, so she copies everything.

            "I had a bestie like that too. She picked up two of my exes. Since we were childhood friends, I never confronted her — just stopped hanging out but kept her on WeChat. After my next breakup, I jokingly texted her: ‘jess, I broke up with zeb, come pick up the trash!’ ...She blocked me right after."

            Maybe she’s just making sure your leftovers are safe. True friend vibes.
