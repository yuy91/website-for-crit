            Authorities report that a Florida man hurled a live alligator into a fast-food restaurant window after receiving cold fries.<br><br>
            The alligator, which was reportedly "very calm," was taken into custody by wildlife officers.<br><br>
            The incident occurred late Tuesday evening at a Taco Bell drive-thru. Witnesses say the suspect, who was wearing a Hawaiian shirt, asked for "extra sauce" before launching the gator through the window.<br><br>
            "It was absolutely crazy," said one employee. "We’ve had our share of strange orders, but that was a new one."
