            "I recently started running—it's great for my health.<br>
            I mean, for <b>MY</b> health. <i>I can't say the same for those I chase.</i>"<br><br>

            "I took a deep breath, calmed myself, and ended the marriage.<br>
            <b>'Fire.'</b>"<br><br>

            "After a long day at work, I was greeted by my brother's smile when I got home.<br>
            <b><i>But... where was the rest of his body?</i></b>"<br><br>

            "I probably should’ve warned her after the party that some guy was following her.<br>  
            I know she gets <b>violent</b> when drunk...<br>  
            <i>But how did she get the body up there?</i>"<br><br>

            "When Jimmy came home smelling like cheap perfume, I thought our marriage was in trouble.<br>  
            We went to counseling. The therapist kept saying, <i>'See through each other’s eyes.'</i><br><br>
            The next morning, <b>I woke up in Jimmy’s body.</b><br><br>
            We talked. Decided to give living like this a try.<br><br>
            Jimmy wasn’t cheating—<b>they’re all in his freezer.</b><br>
            I just hope he checks the basement..."<br><br>

            "'Any last words before I kill you?' the demon roared.<br>
            That was 33 years ago.<br>
            <b><i>I haven't spoken since... but the demon is still waiting.</i></b>"<br>
